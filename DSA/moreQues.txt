Area of rectange and parallelogram= 1/2 * cross product of diagonals. 
Parallelogram and rectangle have same same mid point for both diagonals.
Rectangle same length of diagonals and angle is 90. for parallelogram it can be any same/different

cross is sin and is vector product and sin 90 = 1. and dot is cos for angle.
